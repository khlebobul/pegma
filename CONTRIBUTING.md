### Code Guidelines

- Ensure code follows best practices and is well-documented.
- Format your code using [Dart's formatting guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).

### Building & Running the Project

- To set up the project locally, ensure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) installed. Then run:

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

- For VS Code users `launch.json` (`.vscode/launch.json`):

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "pegma_debug",
      "type": "dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "lib/main.dart"
    },
    {
      "name": "pegma_release",
      "type": "dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "lib/main.dart",
      "args": ["--release"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dependency Management

- Run `flutter pub upgrade` to check for package updates.
- Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible.
